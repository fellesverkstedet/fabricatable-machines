# Experiment: Screw-and-glue valchromat joints

I tried various configurations of screwing valchromat pieces together without predrilling, instead using a 3-axis mill and a 3 mm endmill for slotting tracks for the screw to run in.

### Results

This is the best combination I found in my testing. It uses a 5x50 mm 30 mm threaded wood screw. 

### Failure modes and reasoning

My favourite configuration was a 5 mm diameter wood screw, 3 mm "core" diameter, 50 mm long with an unthreaded neck. This gave the  highest torque before the threads fail. 
The "core" fits prefectly in the 3mm milled slot and gives maximum pressure on the threads without uncessecary friction. 
I think the joint strenght can be further increased by making the slot deeper than the outer diamater of the wood screw but this weakens the valchromat. I recommend 1 mm extra but Slot depth = screw diameter is the minimum.
The length of the slot should be longer than the screw to avoid uncecessary splitting forces from the tip pressing into the end of the slot. 
The hole in the "top" part that you first stick the screw through should be a tight clearance hole for the thread to align well the slot. The hole should be positioned so that the screw thread does not press into the bottom surface/wall of the milled slot, this is to keep the screw from going of course. 

The failure mode is always that the valchromat splits open and then the thread is dug away. Stopping the splitting is key, this keeps the pressure on the threads and prevents them from digging out. The finger joints holds the valchromat together and the unthreaded neck for the woodscrew helps a lots by not introducing any splitting forces from the top of the valchromat.

Another interesting thing to note is that the valchromat will always and only split on the side of the slot that is pushed out by the threads. This means that this method can be used with a single finger joint per screw, preferably positioned close to the hole.

*The valchromat bulges before it fails:*

### Perpendicular screw to prevent splitting 
If you need further strenght I recommend threading a fully threaded wood screw perpendicular through the valchromat where it would bulge and fail from splitting, this screw holds together the valchromat and increases the strength even further. 

### Slot in finger version
I also tried an "extreme" version with the slot in the finger itself, it seemed to work well as well but needs more testing if the head needs a washer for it to work well.
